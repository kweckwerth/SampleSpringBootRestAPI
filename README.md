# SampleSpringBootRestAPI

This is a sample Spring Boot Rest API to retrieve banking branch names.  It supports selecting all or filtered names.  

It uses Mockito to test and Lombok to help with annotations.

To run this simply start it up (I used Intellij) and run "localhost:8080/api/branch/" from Postman. 

Enjoy!
